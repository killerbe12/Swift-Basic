 ## Arrays
 ### Challenge 1.
 Which of the following are valid statements?
*/
 
//let array1 = [Int]()      // your answer here
//let array2 = []           // your answer here
//let array3: [String] = [] // your answer here

//: Given:
let array4 = [1, 2, 3]

//: Which of the following five statements are valid

//print(array4[0])  // your answer here
//print(array4[5])  // your answer here
//array4[1...2]     // your answer here
//array4[0] = 4     // your answer here
//array4.append(4)  // your answer here

//: Given:
var array5 = [1, 2, 3]

//: Which of the five statements are valid?

//array5[0] = array5[1]                 // your answer here
//array5[0...1] = [4, 5]                // your answer here
//array5[0] = "Six"                     // your answer here
//array5 += 6                           // your answer here
//for item in array5 { print(item) }    // your answer here

/*:
 ### Challenge 2
 Write a function that removes the first occurrence of a given integer from an array of integers.
 This is the signature of the function:
 
 ```
 func removingOnce(_ item: Int, from array: [Int]) -> [Int]
 ```
*/

// your code here
/*:
 ### Challenge 3
 Write a function that removes all occurrences of a given integer from an array of integers. 
 This is the signature of the function:
 
```
 func removing(_ item: Int, from array: [Int]) -> [Int]
```
*/

// your code here

/*:
 ### Challenge 4
 Arrays have a `reversed()` method that returns an array holding the same elements as the original array, in reverse order. 
 Write a function that does the same thing, without using `reversed()`. This is the signature of the function:

 ```
 func reversed(_ array: [Int]) -> [Int]
 ```
*/

// your code here

/*:
 ### Challenge 5
 Write a function that returns the middle element of an array.
 When array size is even, return the first of the two middle elements.
 
 ```swift
 func middle(_ array: [Int]) -> Int?
 ```
*/

// your code here

/*:
 ### Challenge 6
 
 Write a function that calculates the minimum and maximum value in an array of integers. 
 Calculate these values yourself, do not use the methods `min` and `max`. 
 Return `nil` if the given array is empty.
 
 This is the signature of the function:

```
func minMax(of numbers: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int)?
```
 
 */
// your code here
/*:
 ## Dictionaries
 ### Challenge 7
 Which of the following statements are valid?
 */

//let dict1: [Int, Int] = [:]   // your answer here
//let dict2 = [:]               // your answer here
//let dict3: [Int: Int] = [:]   // your answer here

//: Given
let dict4 = ["One": 1, "Two": 2, "Three": 3]
//: Which of the following are valid:

//dict4[1]          // your answer here
//dict4["One"]      // your answer here
//dict4["Zero"] = 0 // your answer here
//dict4[0] = "Zero" // your answer here

//: Given
var dict5 = ["NY": "New York", "CA": "California"]

//: Which of the following are valid?
//dict5["NY"]                   // your answer here
//dict5["WA"] = "Washington"    // your answer here
//dict5["CA"] = nil             // your answer here


/*:
 ### Challenge 8
 Given a dictionary with 2-letter state codes as keys and the full state name as values, write a function that prints all the states whose name is longer than 8 characters. For example, for this dictionary ["NY": "New York", "CA": "California"] the output would be "California".
 */

// your code here

/*:
 ### Challenge 9
 Write a function that combines two dictionaries into one. If a certain key appears in both dictionaries, ignore the pair from the first dictionary.
 This is the signature of the function:
 ```
 func combine(dict1: [String: String], with dict2: [String: String]) -> [String: String]
 ```
 */

// your code here

/*:
 ### Challenge 10
 Declare a function `occurrencesOfCharacters` that calculates which characters occur in a string, as well as how often each of these characters occur.
 Return the result as a dictionary. This is the function signature:
 ```
 func occurrencesOfCharacters(in text: String) -> [Character: Int]
 ```
 Hint: `String` is a collection of characters that you can iterate over with a for statement.
*/

// your answer here
/*
 Bonus: To make your code shorter, dictionaries have a special subscript operator that let you add a default value if it is not found in the dictionary. For example, dictionary["a", default: 0] creates a 0 entry for the character "a" if it is not found instead of returning nil.
*/

//func occurrencesOfCharactersBonus(in text: String) -> [Character: Int] {
//  var occurrences: [Character: Int] = [:]
//  for character in text {
//    occurrences[character, default: 0] += 1
//  }
//  return occurrences
//}

/*:
 ### Challenge 11
 Write a function that returns true if all of the values of a dictionary are unique.  Use a set to test uniqueness.
 This is the function signature:
 ```
 func isInvertible(_ dictionary: [String: Int]) -> Bool
 ```
 */
// your code here
