 ## Structures

 ### Challenge
 Write the engine for a Battleship-like game. If you aren’t familiar with Battleship, see here: [http://bit.ly/2nT3JBU](http://bit.ly/2nT3JBU)
 * Use an (x, y) coordinate system for your locations and model using a structure.
 * Ships should also be modelled with structures. Record an origin, direction and length.
 * Each ship should be able to report if a “shot” has resulted in a “hit”.
