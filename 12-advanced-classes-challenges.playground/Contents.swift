 ## Advanced Classes
 ### Challenge 1
 Create three simple classes called `A`, `B`, and `C` where `C` inherits from `B` and `B` inherits from `A`. In each class initializer, call `print("I'm <X>!")` both before and after `super.init()`. Create an instance of `C` called `c`.  What order do you see each `print()` called in?

 ### Challenge 2
  Implement `deinit` for each class. Place your `c` inside of a `do { }` scope which will cause the reference count to go to zero when it exits the scope. What order are the classes deinitialized in?

// your code here for both Challenage 1 and Challenge 2

 ### Challenge 3
 Cast the instance of type `C` to an instance of type `A`. Which casting operation do you use and why?
